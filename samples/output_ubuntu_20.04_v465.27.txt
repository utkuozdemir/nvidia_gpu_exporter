The maximum PCI-E link generation possible with this GPU and system configuration. For example, if the GPU supports a higher PCIe generation than the system supports then this reports the system PCIe generation.

"pcie.link.width.current"
The current PCI-E link width. These may be reduced when the GPU is not in use.

"pcie.link.width.max"
The maximum PCI-E link width possible with this GPU and system configuration. For example, if the GPU supports a higher PCIe generation than the system supports then this reports the system PCIe generation.

"index"
Zero based index of the GPU. Can change at each boot.

"display_mode"
A flag that indicates whether a physical display (e.g. monitor) is currently connected to any of the GPU's connectors. "Enabled" indicates an attached display. "Disabled" indicates otherwise.

"display_active"
A flag that indicates whether a display is initialized on the GPU's (e.g. memory is allocated on the device for display). Display can be active even when no monitor is physically attached. "Enabled" indicates an active display. "Disabled" indicates otherwise.

"persistence_mode"
A flag that indicates whether persistence mode is enabled for the GPU. Value is either "Enabled" or "Disabled". When persistence mode is enabled the NVIDIA driver remains loaded even when no active clients, such as X11 or nvidia-smi, exist. This minimizes the driver load latency associated with running dependent apps, such as CUDA programs. Linux only.

The size of the circular buffer that holds list of processes that can be queried for accounting stats. This is the maximum number of processes that accounting information will be stored for before information about oldest processes will get overwritten by information about new processes.

Section about driver_model properties
On Windows, the TCC and WDDM driver models are supported. The driver model can be changed with the (-dm) or (-fdm) flags. The TCC driver model is optimized for compute applications. I.E. kernel launch times will be quicker with TCC. The WDDM driver model is designed for graphics applications and is not recommended for compute applications. Linux does not support multiple driver models, and will always have the value of "N/A". Only for selected products. Please see feature matrix in NVML documentation.

Version for the ECC recording data.

"inforom.pwr" or "inforom.power"
Version for the power management data.

The "Low Double Precision" mode is designed for running graphics applications that don't require high bandwidth double precision.
GOM can be changed with the (--gom) flag.

"gom.current" or "gpu_operation_mode.current"
The GOM currently in use.

"gom.pending" or "gpu_operation_mode.pending"
The GOM that will be used on the next reboot.

"fan.speed"
The fan speed value is the percent of the product's maximum noise tolerance fan speed that the device's fan is currently intended to run at. This value may exceed 100% in certain cases. Note: The reported speed is the intended fan speed. If the fan is physically blocked and unable to spin, this output will not match the actual fan speed. Many parts do not report fan speeds because they rely on cooling via fans in the surrounding enclosure.

"pstate"
The current performance state for the GPU. States range from P0 (maximum performance) to P12 (minimum performance).

Section about clocks_throttle_reasons properties
Retrieves information about factors that are reducing the frequency of clocks. If all throttle reasons are returned as "Not Active" it means that clocks are running as high as possible.

"clocks_throttle_reasons.supported"
Bitmask of supported clock throttle reasons. See nvml.h for more details.

"clocks_throttle_reasons.active"
Bitmask of active clock throttle reasons. See nvml.h for more details.

 HW Thermal Slowdown: temperature being too high
 HW Power Brake Slowdown: External Power Brake Assertion is triggered (e.g. by the system power supply)
 * Power draw is too high and Fast Trigger protection is reducing the clocks
 * May be also reported during PState or clock change
 * This behavior may be removed in a later release

"clocks_throttle_reasons.hw_thermal_slowdown"
HW Thermal Slowdown (reducing the core clocks by a factor of 2 or more) is engaged. This is an indicator of temperature being too high

"clocks_throttle_reasons.hw_power_brake_slowdown"
HW Power Brake Slowdown (reducing the core clocks by a factor of 2 or more) is engaged. This is an indicator of External Power Brake Assertion being triggered (e.g. by the system power supply)

"clocks_throttle_reasons.sw_thermal_slowdown"
SW Thermal capping algorithm is reducing clocks below requested clocks because GPU temperature is higher than Max Operating Temp.

"clocks_throttle_reasons.sync_boost"
Sync Boost This GPU has been added to a Sync boost group with nvidia-smi or DCGM in
 * order to maximize performance per watt. All GPUs in the sync boost group
 * will boost to the minimum possible clocks across the entire group. Look at
 * the throttle reasons for other GPUs in the system to see why those GPUs are
 * holding this one at lower clocks.

Section about memory properties

"Prohibited" means no contexts are allowed per device (no compute apps).

Section about utilization properties
Utilization rates report how busy each GPU is over time, and can be used to determine how much an application is using the GPUs in the system.

"utilization.gpu"
Percent of time over the past sample period during which one or more kernels was executing on the GPU.
The sample period may be between 1 second and 1/6 second depending on the product.

Section about ecc.errors properties
NVIDIA GPUs can provide error counts for various types of ECC errors. Some ECC errors are either single or double bit, where single bit errors are corrected and double bit errors are uncorrectable. Texture memory errors may be correctable via resend or uncorrectable if the resend fails. These errors are available across two timescales (volatile and aggregate). Single bit ECC errors are automatically corrected by the HW and do not result in data corruption. Double bit errors are detected but not corrected. Please see the ECC documents on the web for information on compute application behavior when double bit errors occur. Volatile error counters track the number of errors detected since the last driver load. Aggregate error counts persist indefinitely and thus act as a lifetime counter.
